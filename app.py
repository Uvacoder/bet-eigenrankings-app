        The basic idea is that for any game we have 1 point to allot. At k = 10, when a team wins by 10 points, .75 points are given to the winner and .25 are given to the loser. \
        If you increase the value of k, the winner is awarded more with respect to the loser. If you decrease it, the points are distributed with more parity. The larger k gets, the \
        closer the function gets to just awarding 1 point for a win and 0 for a loss (like a score-blind model).')

            But all our values of the edge weights need to be positive, both for the math to work and for the graph to make real sense. For the time being, I\'d like to suppose each game is weighted equally \
            (though you can imagine other approaches to this: perhaps more recent games have higher weight, games with higher partiy have higher weight, etc.). \
            So we want a function that both maps margin (which ranges from (-inf, +inf) to some bounded non-negative interval. We also want for this function f to be such that there exists an e such that for all margins in the reals there exists an e such that f(margin) + f(-margin) = e.  \

            it f(margin) + f(-margin) = 1, so for all games 1 point is rewarded. Another thing is that you get diminishing returns for blowouts. The idea is that \
            the difference between a 30 point win and 40 point win is less substantial than the difference between a 10 point win and a 20 point win. \
            Another way to think about it is that the absolute value of the function is always concave down. \n \
            I\'m leaving it open to the user to mess around with a value of k to see what works best. In my own rankings I manually adjust the value of k while paying attention to the tradeoff between wins predicted rate and wins explained rate (I call these predictive / retrodictive accuracy). \
    #         There\'s certainly a better way to do it, and maybe it just requires me being more rigorous about my current method. But I thought it would be fun to make a toy where you can fiddle with this logistic function constant k and see what different rankings it yields.')
